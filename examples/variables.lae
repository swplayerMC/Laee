<> Let's see how variables will work

my_string = "Lae says: hello, world!"
my_integer = 15
my_boolean = true
my_float = 1.6
my_path = p"{#file}" -- variable names that start with '#'s are Special Variables
my_function = function()
  print("Message from a function variable")
done

<<>
  About the Special Variables
  They are defined variables that can get specific types or values
  depending on the context that they're being used.
  I'll create some examples soon.
